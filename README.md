# Stock Analysis
## 1. Overview of the Project
The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve analyze an entire dataset quickly and easily so that he can help his parents make the best decision about which green energy stocks to invest in. In order to make the code more efficient the code was refactored to make the VBA script run faster. 
## 2. Results
Overall, the stocks performed better in 2017 than 2018 with all but one stock having a positive yearly return. Conversely in 2018, all but two stocks had negative yearly returns. Those two stocks ENPH and RUN both had positive yearly returns in 2017 and 2018 and may be good ones for Steve to suggest his parents research further.

## 3. Summary
Some advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code are time. It takes more time to refactor a code after its written, however it saves time each time its run. Itâ€™s advantageous if you are working with a large dataset that will need to run the script often. While it takes more time up front to refactor it will save time in the long run if it is used for frequent deliverables such as monthly financial reports. These pros and cons apply also to refactoring the original VBA script in this project as the script ran five times as fast once it was refactored.
